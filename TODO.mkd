# Bettur URL finding

Currently it looks for a URL in 'single' or "double" quotes, but these are also evil but legit possibilities

## css: 

 * grab start and end { braces }
 * only grab stuff starting with 'url'

## html: find inline CSS and parse it

    <style>
    h1 {color:red;}
    p {color:blue;}
    </style>

  <div style="background: url(x.jpg)" />
